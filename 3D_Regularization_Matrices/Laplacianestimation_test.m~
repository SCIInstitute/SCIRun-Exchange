%% TEST for the laplacian:
%		This script executes two functions to calcualte regularization
%		matrices.
%		
%		surface Laplacian calculates an approximation of the surface first
%		and second derivative operators and then computes a Laplacian
%		matrix from the former.



%% surface Laplacian
	[D,Dtan,H,Htan] = meshsurfdiffhessmatrix(heart,meshnormalvectors(heart));
	Ltan=LaplacianMatrixFromHessianMatrix(Htan);


%% Estimate the 3D laplacian

[D] = PairwiseDistance(heart.node);

% choose sigma
sigma = (sort(D));
sigma = max(sigma,[],2);
sigma = sigma(3);

[wghFcn] = invExplonentialWeight(heart, sigma, 0);

[cDf cHf] = meshVolDiffHessMatrix(heart,wghFcn);
